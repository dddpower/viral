### Key results files

Results for fitness correlation and escape prediction are provided in [fitness_results.txt](fitness_results.txt) and [escape_results.txt](escape_results.txt), respectively.

The `semantics/` directory for each virus contains the CSCS-related information outputted by the viral language model.

The `structure/` directory for each virus contains the PDB file(s) to load, followed by a PyMOL script that can be executed to visualize the protein according to predicted escape potential.
