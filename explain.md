# how to calculate codon mutation (rate, score)
To calculate the single codon mutation probability-natural selection=like score, We used the given codon mutation rate table with the wildtype codon-ammino acid table.

in addition to the grammar and semantic change score from the original table, we adde codon mutation change score to the table.

# about position dependent / independent codon mutation rate 
codon mutation change score is based on two types of experimental data, which are X, Y.
One is
