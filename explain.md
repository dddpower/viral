# how to calculate codon mutation (rate, score)
To calculate the single codon mutation probability-like score, We used the given codon mutation rate table with the wildtype codon-ammino acid table.

in addition to the grammar and semantic change score from the original table, we adde codon mutation change score to the table.

Two main views exist codon mutation change score
